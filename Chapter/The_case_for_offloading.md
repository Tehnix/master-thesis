# The Case for Offloading {#cha:case_for_offloading}
Go through [@Golkarifard2017], [@Jiao2013] and [@Nabi2015].


## Saving Energy with Offloading {#sec:case_energy}
Make an overview of the different systems from \cite{cha:related_work} showing their improvement in energy consumption. Also take a look at [@Gupta2013], [@Vallina-rodriguez2012]


## When to offload {#sec:case_when}
Take a look at [@Flores2013], and also the recommendations from [@Golkarifard2017], [@Jiao2013] and [@Nabi2015]. Additionally [@Huang2012] might be interesting.


### What network conditions? {#sec:case_when_network}
This goes back to [@Golkarifard2017], [@Jiao2013] and [@Nabi2015] again.



[@Cuervo2010] In implementing MAUI, we discovered a number of unforeseen challenges to implementing program partitioning for mobile appli- cations. One such challenge is that using power-save mode (PSM) when transferring state remotely can hurt the overall energy con- sumption of the application when the latency to the server is low. Moreover, PSM mode helps save energy but only when latencies approach the sleep interval (todayâ€™s hardware uses 100 ms).
They also mention that \gls{rtt} has significant impact on the energy consumption, especially as the data size goes up (see page no. 51).


### What about input/output size? {#sec:case_when_input}
Again we go back to [@Golkarifard2017], [@Jiao2013] and [@Nabi2015] again.
