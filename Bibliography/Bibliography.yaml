  title: '[A Close Examination of Performance and Power Characteristics of 4G LTE
    Networks]{.nocase}'
  container-title: MobiSys
  page: '225-238'
  abstract: With the recent advent of 4G LTE networks, there has been increasing interest
    to better understand the performance and power characteristics, compared with
    3G/WiFi networks. In this paper, we take one of the first steps in this direction.
    Using a publicly deployed tool we designed for Android called 4GTest attracting
    more than 3000 users within 2 months and extensive local experiments, we study
    the network performance of LTE networks and compare with other types of mobile
    networks. We observe LTE generally has significantly higher downlink and uplink
    throughput than 3G and even WiFi, with a median value of 13Mbps and 6Mbps, respectively.
    We develop the first empirically derived comprehensive power model of a commercial
    LTE network with less than 6% error rate and state transitions matching the specifications.
    Using a comprehensive data set consisting of 5-month traces of 20 smartphone users,
    we carefully investigate the energy usage in 3G, LTE, and WiFi networks and evaluate
    the impact of configuring LTE-related parameters. Despite several new power saving
    improvements, we find that LTE is as much as 23 times less power efficient compared
    with WiFi, and even less power efficient than 3G, based on the user traces and
    the long high power tail is found to be a key contributor. In addition, we perform
    case studies of several popular applications on Android in LTE and identify that
    the performance bottleneck for web-based applications lies less in the network,
    compared to our previous study in 3G \[24\]. Instead, the device’s processing
    power, despite the significant improvement compared to our analysis two years
    ago, becomes more of a bottleneck.

  issue: Section 9
  abstract: 'We describe a new programming idiom for concurrency, based on Applicative
    Functors, where concurrency is implicit in the Applicative &lt;\*&gt; operator.
    The result is that concurrent programs can be written in a natural applicative
    style, and they retain a high degree of clarity and modularity while executing
    with maximal concur- rency. This idiom is particularly useful for programming
    against external data sources, where the application code is written without the
    use of explicit concurrency constructs, while the implementa- tion is able to
    batch together multiple requests for data from the same source, and fetch data
    from multiple sources concurrently. Our abstraction uses a cache to ensure that
    multiple requests for the same data return the same result, which frees the programmer
    from having to arrange to fetch data only once, which in turn leads to greater
    modularity. While it is generally applicable, our technique was designed with
    a particular application in mind: an internal service at Facebook that identifies
    particular types of content and takes actions based on it. Our application has
    a large body of business logic that fetches data from several different external
    sources. The framework described in this paper enables the business logic to execute
    efficiently by automatically fetching data concurrently; we present some preliminary
    results.'

  volume: '17'
  abstract: 'This paper presents MAUI, a system that enables fine-grained energy-aware
    offload of mobile code to the infrastructure. Previous approaches to these problems
    either relied heavily on programmer support to partition an application, or they
    were coarse-grained re- quiring full process (or full VM) migration. MAUI uses
    the benefits of a managed code environment to offer the best of both worlds: it
    supports fine-grained code offload to maximize energy savings with minimal burden
    on the programmer. MAUI decides at run- time which methods should be remotely
    executed, driven by an op- timization engine that achieves the best energy savings
    possible un- der the mobile devices current connectivity constrains. In our eval-
    uation, we show that MAUI enables: 1) a resource-intensive face recognition application
    that consumes an order of magnitude less energy, 2) a latency-sensitive arcade
    game application that doubles its refresh rate, and 3) a voice-based language
    translation applica- tion that bypasses the limitations of the smartphone environment
    by executing unsupported components remotely.'

  abstract: Caching at the wireless edge is a promising way to boost spectral efficiency
    and reduce energy consumption of wireless systems. These improvements are rooted
    in the fact that popular contents are reused, asynchronously, by many users. In
    this article we first introduce methods to predict the popularity distributions
    and user preferences, and the impact of erroneous information. We then discuss
    the two aspects of caching systems, content placement and delivery. We expound
    the key differences between wired and wireless caching, and outline the differences
    in the system arising from where the caching takes place (e.g., at base stations
    or on the wireless devices themselves). Special attention is paid to the essential
    limitations in wireless caching, and possible trade-offs between spectral efficiency,
    energy efficiency, and cache size. 2016 IEEE.

  title: '[Revisiting Network Energy Efficiency of Mobile Apps : Performance in
    the Wild]{.nocase}'
  container-title: HotMobile ’15
  page: '339-345'
  abstract: Energy consumption due to network traffic on mobile devices continues
    to be a significant concern. We examine a range of excessive energy consumption
    problems caused by background network traffic through a two-year user study, and
    also validate these findings through in-lab testing of the most recent versions
    of major mobile apps. We discover a new energy consumption problem where foreground
    network traffic persists after switching from the foreground to the background,
    leading to unnecessary energy and data drain. Furthermore, while we find some
    apps have taken steps to improve the energy impact of periodic background traffic,
    energy consumption differences of up to an order of magnitude exist between apps
    with near-identical functionality. Finally, by examining how apps are used in
    the wild, we find that some apps continue to generate unneeded traffic for days
    when the app is not being used, and in some cases this wasted traffic is responsible
    for a majority of the app’s network energy overhead. We propose that these persistent,
    widespread and varied sources of excessive energy consumption in popular apps
    should be addressed through new app management tools that tailor network activity
    to user interaction patterns. 2015 ACM.

  abstract: In cellular networks, it is important to conserve energy while at the
    same time ensuring users to have good transmission experiences. The energy cost
    can result from tail energy due to the radio resource control strategies designed
    in cellular networks and data transmission. Existing efforts generally consider
    one of the energy issues, and also ignore the adverse impact on user transmission
    performance due to energy conservation. In addition, many existing algorithms
    are based on prediction and knowledge on future traffic, which are hard to apply
    in a practical wireless system with dynamic user traffic and channel condition.
    The goal of this work is to design an efficient online scheduling algorithm to
    minimize energy consumption both due to tail energy and transmissions while meeting
    user performance expectation. We prove the problem to be NP-hard, and design a
    practical online scheduling algorithm PerES to minimize the total energy cost
    of multiple mobile applications subject to user performance constraints. We propose
    a comprehensive performance cost metric to capture the impacts due to task delay,
    deadline violation, different application profiles and user preferences. We prove
    that our proposed scheduling algorithm can make the energy consumption arbitrarily
    close to that of the optimal scheduling solution. The evaluation results demonstrate
    the effectiveness of our scheme and its higher performance than peers. Moreover,
    by supporting dynamic performance requirement by mobile users, PerES can achieve
    2 times faster convergence to both the performance degradation bound and optimal
    energy conversation bound than those of traditional static methods. Using 821
    million traffic flows collected from a commercial cellular carrier, we verify
    our scheme could achieve on average 32%-56% energy savings with different levels
    of user experience. 2014 IEEE.

  abstract: 'The rapidly increasing number of mobile devices, voluminous data, and
    higher data rate are pushing to rethink the current generation of the cellular
    mobile communication. The next or fifth generation (5G) cellular networks are
    expected to meet high-end requirements. The 5G networks are broadly characterized
    by three unique features: ubiquitous connectivity, extremely low latency, and
    very high-speed data transfer. The 5G networks would provide novel architectures
    and technologies beyond state-of-the-art architectures and technologies. In this
    paper, our intent is to find an answer to the question: “what will be done by
    5G and how?” We investigate and discuss serious limitations of the fourth generation
    (4G) cellular networks and corresponding new features of 5G networks. We identify
    challenges in 5G networks, new technologies for 5G networks, and present a comparative
    study of the proposed architectures that can be categorized on the basis of energy-efficiency,
    network hierarchy, and network types. Interestingly, the implementation issues,
    e.g., interference, QoS, handoff, security-privacy, channel access, and load balancing,
    hugely effect the realization of 5G networks. Furthermore, our illustrations highlight
    the feasibility of these models through an evaluation of existing real-experiments
    and testbeds.'

  abstract: 'Linear and affine type systems have a long and storied history, but

    two crucial properties in mind: backwards-compatibility and code reuse across
    linear and non-linear users of a library. Only then can the benefits of linear
    types permeate conventional functional programming. Rather than bifurcate data
    types into linear and non-linear counterparts, we instead attach linearity to
    binders. Linear function types can receive inputs from linearly-bound values,
    but can also operate over unrestricted, regular values. Linear types are an enabling
    tool for safe and resource efficient systems programming. We explore the power
    of linear types with a case study of a large, in-memory data structures that must

  container-title: MobileDeLi 2015 - Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop
    on Mobile Development Lifecycle
  page: '17-24'
  abstract: 'This paper presents the results of a formative study conducted to determine
    the effects of computation offloading in mobile applications by comparing application
    performance (chiefly energy consumption and response time). The study examined
    two general execution scenarios: (1) computation is performed locally on a mobile
    device, and (2) computation is offloaded entirely to the cloud. The study also
    carefully considered the underlying network characteristics as an important factor
    affecting the performance. More specifically, we refactored two mobile applications
    to offload their computationally intensive functionality to execute in the cloud.
    We then profiled these applications under different network conditions, and carefully
    measured application performance in each case. The results indicate that on fast
    networks, offloading is almost always beneficial. However, on slower networks,
    the offloading cost-benefit analysis is not as clear cut. The characteristics
    of the data transferred between the mobile device and the cloud may be a deciding
    factor in determining whether computation offloading would improve performance.

  abstract: Mobile Internet applications run on devices such as smartphones and tablets,
    and have dramatically changed the landscape of applicationgenerated network traffic.
    The potent combination of millions of such applications and the instant accessibility
    of high-speed Internet on mobile devices through 3G and now LTE technology has
    also changed how users themselves interact with the Internet. Specifically, the
    radio states in LTE such as RRC\_Connected and RRC\_Idle were designed with more
    traditional applications such as web browsing and FTP in mind. These traditional
    applications typically generated traffic only during Active (Connected) state,
    and once the user session ended, usually the traffic ended too, thus allowing
    the radio to move to Inactive (Idle) state. However, newer applications such as
    Facebook and Twitter generate a constant stream of autonomous and/or user generated
    traffic at all times, thus erasing the previously clear demarcation between Active
    and Inactive states. This means a given mobile device (or user equipment, in LTE
    parlance) often ends up moving between Connected and Idle states frequently to
    send mostly short bursts of data, draining device battery and causing excessive
    signaling overhead in LTE networks. This problem has grown and attracted the research
    community’s attention to address the negative effects of frequent back and forth
    transitions between LTE radio states. In this article, we first explore the traffic
    characteristics of these emerging mobile Internet applications and how they differ
    from more traditional applications. We investigate their impact on LTE device
    power and air interface signaling. We then present a survey of state-of-the-art
    solutions proposed in literature to address the problems, and analyze their merits
    and demerits. Lastly, we discuss the solutions adopted by 3GPP including the latest
    developments in Release 11 to handle these issues, and present potential future
    research directions in this field.
