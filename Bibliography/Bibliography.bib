@article{Marlow2006,
abstract = {Higher-order languages that encourage currying are typically implemented using one of two basic evaluation models: push/enter or eval/apply. Implementors use their intuition and qualitative judgements to choose one model or the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide, for the first time, a more substantial basis for this choice, based on our qualitative and quantitative experience of implementing both models in a state-of-the-art compiler for Haskell. Our conclusion is simple, and contradicts our initial intuition: compiled implementations should use eval/apply. Capsule Review Language implementors are often faced with choices about how to implement a particular language feature. Unfortunately, there is often little empirical evidence to guide us in these choices and we must rely on our, often faulty, intuition. This paper examines the choice between two different implementation techniques for curried function application and provides important guidance to future implementors about this choice. The two techniques are " push/enter, " where the callee is responsible for arity matching, and " eval/apply, " where the caller is responsible for arity matching. While many people's intuition might be that " push/enter " is more efficient, and thus worth a more complex implementation, this paper shows that, in fact, the two techniques have essentially the same performance on a wide range of Haskell programs. Thus, one concludes that implementors should choose the simpler approach: namely, eval/apply.},

abstract = {Recent work has studied the effect that factors such as code obfuscation, refactorings and data types have on energy efficiency. In this paper, we attempt to shed light on the energy behavior of programs written in a lazy purely functional language, Haskell. We have conducted two empirical studies to analyze the energy efficiency of Haskell programs from two different perspectives: strictness and concurrency. Our experimental space exploration comprises more than 2000 configurations and 20000 executions. We found out that small changes can make a big difference in terms of energy consumption. For example, in one of our benchmarks, under a specific configuration, choosing one data sharing primitive (MVar) over another (TMVar) can yield 60{\%} energy savings. In another benchmark, the latter primitive can yield up to 30{\%} energy savings over the former. Thus, tools that support developers in quickly refactoring a program to switch between different primitives can be of great help if energy is a concern. In addition, the relationship between energy consumption and performance is not always clear. In sequential benchmarks, high performance is an accurate proxy for low energy consumption. However, for one of our concurrent bench- marks, the variants with the best performance also exhibited the worst energy consumption. To support developers in better understanding this complex relationship, we have extended two existing performance analysis tools to also collect and present data about energy consumption.},

With the number of just mobile devices now reaching nearly equal to the population of earth, embedded systems have truly become ubiquitous.

In this paper, we survey the techniques for managing power consumption of embedded systems. We discuss the need of power management and provide a classification of the techniques on several important parameters to highlight their similarities and differences.

abstract = {What is the effect of programming languages on software qual-ity? This question has been a topic of much debate for a very long time. In this study, we gather a very large data set from GitHub (729 projects, 80 Million SLOC, 29,000 authors, 1.5 million com-mits, in 17 languages) in an attempt to shed some empirical light on this question. This reasonably large sample size allows us to use a mixed-methods approach, combining multiple regression model-ing with visualization and text analytics, to study the effect of lan-guage features such as static v.s. dynamic typing, strong v.s. weak typing on software quality. By triangulating findings from differ-ent methods, and controlling for confounding effects such as team size, project size, and project history, we report that language de-sign does have a significant, but modest effect on software quality. Most notably, it does appear that strong typing is modestly better than weak typing, and among functional languages, static typing is also somewhat better than dynamic typing. We also find that func-tional languages are somewhat better than procedural languages. It is worth noting that these modest effects arising from language de-sign are overwhelmingly dominated by the process factors such as project size, team size, and commit size. However, we hasten to caution the reader that even these modest effects might quite possi-bly be due to other, intangible process factors, e.g., the preference of certain personality types for functional, static and strongly typed languages.},

abstract = {We present a rational reconstruction of extensible effects, the recently proposed alternative to monad transformers, as the confluence of efforts to make effectful computations compose. Free monads and then extensible effects emerge from the straightforward term representation of an effectful computation, as more and more boilerplate is abstracted away. The generalization process further leads to freer monads, constructed without the Functor constraint. The continuation exposed in freer monads can then be represented as an efficient type-aligned data structure. The end result is the algorithmically efficient extensible effects library, which is not only more comprehensible but also faster than earlier implementations. As an illustration of the new library, we show three surprisingly simple applications: non-determinism with committed choice (LogicT), catching IO exceptions in the presence of other effects, and the semi-automatic management of file handles and other resources through monadic regions. We extensively use and promote the new sort of `laziness', which underlies the left Kan extension: instead of performing an operation, keep its operands and pretend it is done.},

Questions about which language is more succinct or efficient, or makes developers more productive are discussed with fervor, and their answers are too often based on anecdotes and unsubstantiated beliefs. In this study, we use the largely untapped research potential of Rosetta Code, a code repository of solutions to common programming tasks in various languages, to draw a fair and well-founded comparison. Rosetta Code offers a large data set for analysis. Our study is based on 7087 solution programs corresponding to 745 tasks in 8 widely used languages representing the major programming paradigms (procedural: C and Go; object-oriented: C{\#} and Java; functional: F{\#} and Haskell; scripting: Python and Ruby). Our statistical analysis reveals, most notably, that: functional and scripting languages are more concise than procedural and object-oriented languages; C is hard to beat when it comes to raw speed on large inputs, but performance differences over inputs of moderate size are less pronounced and allow even interpreted languages to be competitive; compiled strongly-typed languages, where more defects can be caught at compile time, are less prone to runtime failures than interpreted or weakly-typed languages. We discuss implications of these results for developers, language designers, and educators.},

abstract = {With the recent advent of 4G LTE networks, there has been increasing interest to better understand the performance and power characteristics, compared with 3G/WiFi networks. In this paper, we take one of the first steps in this direction. Using a publicly deployed tool we designed for Android called 4GTest attracting more than 3000 users within 2 months and extensive local experiments, we study the network performance of LTE networks and compare with other types of mobile networks. We observe LTE generally has significantly higher downlink and uplink throughput than 3G and even WiFi, with a median value of 13Mbps and 6Mbps, respectively. We develop the first empirically derived comprehensive power model of a commercial LTE network with less than 6{\%} error rate and state transitions matching the specifications. Using a comprehensive data set consisting of 5-month traces of 20 smartphone users, we carefully investigate the energy usage in 3G, LTE, and WiFi networks and evaluate the impact of configuring LTE-related parameters. Despite several new power saving improvements, we find that LTE is as much as 23 times less power efficient compared with WiFi, and even less power efficient than 3G, based on the user traces and the long high power tail is found to be a key contributor. In addition, we perform case studies of several popular applications on Android in LTE and identify that the performance bottleneck for web-based applications lies less in the network, compared to our previous study in 3G [24]. Instead, the device's processing power, despite the significant improvement compared to our analysis two years ago, becomes more of a bottleneck.},

abstract = {We describe a new programming idiom for concurrency, based on Applicative Functors, where concurrency is implicit in the Applicative {\textless}*{\textgreater} operator. The result is that concurrent programs can be written in a natural applicative style, and they retain a high degree of clarity and modularity while executing with maximal concur- rency. This idiom is particularly useful for programming against external data sources, where the application code is written without the use of explicit concurrency constructs, while the implementa- tion is able to batch together multiple requests for data from the same source, and fetch data from multiple sources concurrently. Our abstraction uses a cache to ensure that multiple requests for the same data return the same result, which frees the programmer from having to arrange to fetch data only once, which in turn leads to greater modularity. While it is generally applicable, our technique was designed with a particular application in mind: an internal service at Facebook that identifies particular types of content and takes actions based on it. Our application has a large body of business logic that fetches data from several different external sources. The framework described in this paper enables the business logic to execute efficiently by automatically fetching data concurrently; we present some preliminary results.},

abstract = {This paper presents MAUI, a system that enables fine-grained energy-aware offload of mobile code to the infrastructure. Previous approaches to these problems either relied heavily on programmer support to partition an application, or they were coarse-grained re- quiring full process (or full VM) migration. MAUI uses the benefits of a managed code environment to offer the best of both worlds: it supports fine-grained code offload to maximize energy savings with minimal burden on the programmer. MAUI decides at run- time which methods should be remotely executed, driven by an op- timization engine that achieves the best energy savings possible un- der the mobile devices current connectivity constrains. In our eval- uation, we show that MAUI enables: 1) a resource-intensive face recognition application that consumes an order of magnitude less energy, 2) a latency-sensitive arcade game application that doubles its refresh rate, and 3) a voice-based language translation applica- tion that bypasses the limitations of the smartphone environment by executing unsupported components remotely.},

These improvements are rooted in the fact that popular contents are reused, asynchronously, by many users. In this article we first introduce methods to predict the popularity distributions and user preferences, and the impact of erroneous information. We then discuss the two aspects of caching systems, content placement and delivery. We expound the key differences between wired and wireless caching, and outline the differences in the system arising from where the caching takes place (e.g., at base stations or on the wireless devices themselves). Special attention is paid to the essential limitations in wireless caching, and possible trade-offs between spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and cache size. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Energy consumption due to network traffic on mobile devices continues to be a significant concern. We examine a range of excessive energy consumption problems caused by background network traffic through a two-year user study, and also validate these findings through in-lab testing of the most recent versions of major mobile apps. We discover a new energy consumption problem where foreground network traffic persists after switching from the foreground to the background, leading to unnecessary energy and data drain. Furthermore, while we find some apps have taken steps to improve the energy impact of periodic background traffic, energy consumption differences of up to an order of magnitude exist between apps with near-identical functionality. Finally, by examining how apps are used in the wild, we find that some apps continue to generate unneeded traffic for days when the app is not being used, and in some cases this wasted traffic is responsible for a majority of the app's network energy overhead. We propose that these persistent, widespread and varied sources of excessive energy consumption in popular apps should be addressed through new app management tools that tailor network activity to user interaction patterns. {\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.},

abstract = {In cellular networks, it is important to conserve energy while at the same time ensuring users to have good transmission experiences. The energy cost can result from tail energy due to the radio resource control strategies designed in cellular networks and data transmission. Existing efforts generally consider one of the energy issues, and also ignore the adverse impact on user transmission performance due to energy conservation. In addition, many existing algorithms are based on prediction and knowledge on future traffic, which are hard to apply in a practical wireless system with dynamic user traffic and channel condition. The goal of this work is to design an efficient online scheduling algorithm to minimize energy consumption both due to tail energy and transmissions while meeting user performance expectation. We prove the problem to be NP-hard, and design a practical online scheduling algorithm PerES to minimize the total energy cost of multiple mobile applications subject to user performance constraints. We propose a comprehensive performance cost metric to capture the impacts due to task delay, deadline violation, different application profiles and user preferences. We prove that our proposed scheduling algorithm can make the energy consumption arbitrarily close to that of the optimal scheduling solution. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme and its higher performance than peers. Moreover, by supporting dynamic performance requirement by mobile users, PerES can achieve 2 times faster convergence to both the performance degradation bound and optimal energy conversation bound than those of traditional static methods. Using 821 million traffic flows collected from a commercial cellular carrier, we verify our scheme could achieve on average 32{\%}-56{\%} energy savings with different levels of user experience. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The rapidly increasing number of mobile devices, voluminous data, and higher data rate are pushing to rethink the current generation of the cellular mobile communication. The next or fifth generation (5G) cellular networks are expected to meet high-end requirements. The 5G networks are broadly characterized by three unique features: ubiquitous connectivity, extremely low latency, and very high-speed data transfer. The 5G networks would provide novel architectures and technologies beyond state-of-the-art architectures and technologies. In this paper, our intent is to find an answer to the question: "what will be done by 5G and how?" We investigate and discuss serious limitations of the fourth generation (4G) cellular networks and corresponding new features of 5G networks. We identify challenges in 5G networks, new technologies for 5G networks, and present a comparative study of the proposed architectures that can be categorized on the basis of energy-efficiency, network hierarchy, and network types. Interestingly, the implementation issues, e.g., interference, QoS, handoff, security-privacy, channel access, and load balancing, hugely effect the realization of 5G networks. Furthermore, our illustrations highlight the feasibility of these models through an evaluation of existing real-experiments and testbeds.},

In this paper, we introduce and study a linear type system designed with two crucial properties in mind: backwards-compatibility and code reuse across linear and non-linear users of a library. Only then can the benefits of linear types permeate conventional functional programming. Rather than bifurcate data types into linear and non-linear counterparts, we instead attach linearity to binders. Linear function types can receive inputs from linearly-bound values, but can also operate over unrestricted, regular values. Linear types are an enabling tool for safe and resource efficient systems programming. We explore the power of linear types with a case study of a large, in-memory data structures that must serve responses with low latency.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a formative study conducted to determine the effects of computation offloading in mobile applications by comparing application performance (chiefly energy consumption and response time). The study examined two general execution scenarios: (1) computation is performed locally on a mobile device, and (2) computation is offloaded entirely to the cloud. The study also carefully considered the underlying network characteristics as an important factor affecting the performance. More specifically, we refactored two mobile applications to offload their computationally intensive functionality to execute in the cloud. We then profiled these applications under different network conditions, and carefully measured application performance in each case. The results indicate that on fast networks, offloading is almost always beneficial. However, on slower networks, the offloading cost-benefit analysis is not as clear cut. The characteristics of the data transferred between the mobile device and the cloud may be a deciding factor in determining whether computation offloading would improve performance. {\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.},

abstract = {Mobile Internet applications run on devices such as smartphones and tablets, and have dramatically changed the landscape of applicationgenerated network traffic. The potent combination of millions of such applications and the instant accessibility of high-speed Internet on mobile devices through 3G and now LTE technology has also changed how users themselves interact with the Internet. Specifically, the radio states in LTE such as RRC{\_}Connected and RRC{\_}Idle were designed with more traditional applications such as web browsing and FTP in mind. These traditional applications typically generated traffic only during Active (Connected) state, and once the user session ended, usually the traffic ended too, thus allowing the radio to move to Inactive (Idle) state. However, newer applications such as Facebook and Twitter generate a constant stream of autonomous and/or user generated traffic at all times, thus erasing the previously clear demarcation between Active and Inactive states. This means a given mobile device (or user equipment, in LTE parlance) often ends up moving between Connected and Idle states frequently to send mostly short bursts of data, draining device battery and causing excessive signaling overhead in LTE networks. This problem has grown and attracted the research community's attention to address the negative effects of frequent back and forth transitions between LTE radio states. In this article, we first explore the traffic characteristics of these emerging mobile Internet applications and how they differ from more traditional applications. We investigate their impact on LTE device power and air interface signaling. We then present a survey of state-of-the-art solutions proposed in literature to address the problems, and analyze their merits and demerits. Lastly, we discuss the solutions adopted by 3GPP including the latest developments in Release 11 to handle these issues, and present potential future research directions in this field.},
